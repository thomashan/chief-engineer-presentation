                    probably. And, no; the database is not one of the most important decisions. ... The database is
                    merely an IO device. It happens to provide some useful tools for sorting, querying, and reporting
                    but those are ancillary to the system architecture.</q></p>

                </ul>
                <p class="fragment">because the business rules do not depend upon the tools of the database, nor the
                    framework, nor the web server, nor how it's delivered.</p>

                <p class="fragment">I didn't say don't use those tools. I said business rules shouldn’t depend upon
                    them.</p>

                <p class="fragment">I'm not saying don't upgrade the database, I'm asking whether millions of dollars
                    and thousands of man hours is warranted to upgrade a database system.</p>
