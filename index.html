                <p>A: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">I want to become a Software Architect.</q></p>
                <p class="fragment">B: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">That’s a fine goal for a young software developer.</q></p>
                <p class="fragment">A: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">I want to lead a team and make all the important decisions about databases and frameworks and web-servers and all that stuff.</q></p>
                <p class="fragment">B: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">Oh. Well, then you don’t want to become a Software Architect after all.</q></p>
                <p class="fragment">A: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">Of course I do! I want to be the one who makes all the important decisions.</q></p>

                <p>B: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">That’s fine, but you didn’t list the important decisions. You listed the irrelevant ones.</q></p>
                <p class="fragment">A: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">What do you mean? The Database isn’t an important decision? Do you know how much money we spend on them?</q></p>
                <p class="fragment">B: <q cite="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">Too much probably. And, no; the database is not one of the most important decisions. ... The database is merely an IO device. It happens to provide some useful tools for sorting, querying, and reporting but those are ancillary to the system architecture.</q></p>

                    <li>database</li>
                    <li>framework</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="fragment">because the business rules do not depend upon the tools of the database, nor the framework, nor the web servers, nor how it's delivered.</p>

                <h3>You're talking gibberish.</h3>
                <p class="fragment">Am I?</p>
                <p class="fragment">On the contrary, it's the fundamentals of software architecture!</p>
                <p class="fragment">I didn't say don't use those tools. I said business rules shouldn’t depend upon them.</p>
                <p class="fragment">Business rules (highest level policies) shouldn't depend upon low level tools.</p>
                <p class="fragment">This is called the Dependency Inversion Principle or the Inversion of control principal.</p>

                <h2>Architecture misconceptions everywhere!</h2>
                <p>Enterprises spend millions of dollars and months to years of work to upgrade a database.</p>
                <p class="fragment">And what business value did the upgrade bring?</p>
                <p class="fragment">I'm not saying don't upgrade the database, I'm asking whether millions of dollars and thousands of man hours is warranted to upgrade a database system.</p>
                <p class="fragment">What if they abstracted away the tools into the business rules...</p>
                <p class="fragment">All they had to do was to test the concrete implementation of the business rules using the database</p>
